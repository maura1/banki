## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [ ] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:**The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is   written in. 
  - **Use:** This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers. It must be the very first line of code in an HTML document(aside from comments, which can go before if needed).
  - **Example:** ##This is the doctype syntax for HTML5 and beyond: `<DOCTYPE html>`
  - **Source:** https//www.freecodecamp.org

- [ ] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** By setting the lang attributes on various elements within the page.
  - **Use:** The lang attribute can be defined anywhere in the document  eg: html, p, li..
  - **Example:** The whole site for example can be set in english by setting the `<html lang="en">`
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang

- [ ] What kinds of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:**Some nuances to pay attention to including:
    - Including the `lang` attribute
    - Allowing users to change the language
    - Minimize text in raster based images
    - Text overflow when translated
    - How colors are perceived
    - Date and currency formats
    - Language reading direction
    - Don't concatenate translated strings
  - **Use:**Respecting all users that user your site
  - **Example:**Colors are percieved differently accross languages and cultures.
  - **Source:**https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions

- [ ] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:** To store custom private data to the page or application.
  - **Use:** They used to be used to store data in the DOM, but that is generally discouraged now, as the user could
      modify the data attributes easily by using the inspect element in the browser.
  - **Example:** A valid reason for using data attributes, is to add a hook for end to end testing fromeworks such 
    as Selenium and Capybara without having to create meaningless classes or ID attributes.
  - **Source:**https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions

- [ ] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:**
      - Semantics - Allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.
      - Connectivity - Allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.
      - Offline and storage - Allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more          efficiently.
      - Multimedia - Making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.
      - 2D/3D graphics and effects - Allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.
      - Performance and integration - Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.
      - Device access - Allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.
      - Styling - Letting authors write more sophisticated themes  
  - **Source:**https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5

- [ ] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:**Cookies can be initiated by the server, have a manually set expiration date, a small file size and   are sent to the server with a HTTP request.
  Local and session are both initiated by the client, are a relatively large file and are not sent to the server. 
  Local storage persists forever until cleared manualy. 
  Session storage is cleared when the tab is closed
  - **Use:** They are all used for client side storage of strings in key-value pairs.

- [ ] Describe the difference between `<script>, <script async> and <script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**

- [ ] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:**
  `<script>`HTML parsing is blocked, script is fetched and executed immediately
  `<script async>`script is fetched in paralled to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available.
  `<script defer>`script fetched in paralled ot HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing.
  - **Use:**
  - Use `async`when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page
  - Use `defer`when you need to ensure that the HTML is fully parsed before executing.
  - **Example:**
  - `async`could be used for analytical scripts.
  - A defered script should not contain `document.write`
    ##The async and defer attributes are ignored for scripts that have no `src`attributes.
  - **Source:**https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions

- [ ] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:** Techniques used to imporve performance of a web page to render content for display as quickly as possible.
  - **Use:** Imporving perceived loadtime.
  - **Example:** Lazy loading of images, prioritizing visible content ( or above-the-fold rendering) and async HTML fragments.
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions

- [ ] Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
  - **Explanation:** It is used when you want to serve different images to users depending on their device display width - 
  - **Use:** Serve higher quality images to devices with retina display enhances the  user experience while serving lower resolution images to low-end devices increse performance and decrease data wastage(because serving a larger image will not have any visible difference)
  - **Example:** `<img srcset="small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w" src="..." alt="">`
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions

- [ ] Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
  - **Explanation:** EJS ans Handlebars They provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. Most templating engines will also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you need custom processing before display.
  - **Use:** When using dynamic data.
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions

### CSS

- [ ] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:** The means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.
  - **Use:** Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector.
  - **Example:** Id's count for 100, classes for 10 and tags 1, therefore a selector of `#id .class tag` would have 111 points as
  - **Source:** https://www.sitepoint.com/css-selectors-specificity/

- [ ] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:**  "Normalize" alters the default styles of various browsers to match each other. "Reset" will remove the browsers default styles so you are starting from scratch.
  - **Use:** Normalizing preserves useful default styles rather than "unstyling" everything. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.
   The main purpose of applying either "normalize" or "reset" is to try and make websites visually consistent across different browsers. A mix of both can be used, normalize to keep it conscise and then add some elements like anchors and headers with a reset.
  - **Example:**
  Normalize:
  

h1{
  font-size:2em
  margin : 1em;
}
 

Reset:

``` 
html, body, div, span, ..., audio, video {  
   margin: 0;  
   padding: 0;  
   border: 0;  
   font-size: 100%;  
   font: inherit;  
   vertical-align: baseline; 
}
```

- [ ] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:** Float is a CSS positioning property where the element that is floated will be removed from the flow of the page and affect the elements around it. A parent element will collapse to zero height if it contains only floated elements, to fix this it was common to use a `.clearfix` hack.
  The .clearfix hack uses a clever CSS pseudo selector (:after) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class clearfix to it. Then apply this CSS:
```
.clearfix:after {
  content: ' ';
  visibility: hidden;
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  clear: both;
}
```
Alternatively, give overflow: auto or overflow: hidden property to the parent element which will establish a new block formatting context inside the children and it will expand to contain its children.

  - **Use:** It was used prior to flex and grid to layout pages in a more flexible manner.
  - **Example:** To position three elemetns of equal width equally accross the page you could use float left  and give them widths of 33.3% .
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/

- [ ] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:**The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of overlapping HTML elements. z-index only affects elements that have a position value which is not static.
  Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.

  Without any z-index value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their children) will always appear on top of elements with default static positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.
  - **Use:**To determind in which order elements will be displayed on top of each order.
  - **Example:**
  /* Default value if not specified */
z-index: auto;

/* Integer values */
z-index: 1;
z-index: 100;
z-index: 9999;
z-index: -1;

/* Global values */
z-index: inherit;
z-index: initial;
z-index: unset;

- [ ] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:**
  It is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out.
  Floats, absolutely positioned elements, inline-blocks, table-cells, table-captions, and elements with overflow other than visible (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.

  A BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
    - The value of float is not none.
    - The value of position is neither static nor relative.
    - The value of display is table-cell, table-caption, inline-block, flex, or inline-flex, grid, or inline-grid.
    - The value of overflow is not visible.
  - **Use:**Knowing how to establish a block formatting context is important, because without doing so, the containing box will not contain floated children
  - **Example:** Without forming a BFC you could have content of a float that is taller than the content alongside it. The border of the parent element could then "cut-through" the floated box.
  - **Source:**https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context

- [ ] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:**  
  - Empty div method - <div style="clear:both;"></div>.
  - Clearfix method - Refer to the .clearfix class above.
  - Overflow: auto or overflow: hidden method - Parent will establish a new block formatting context and expand to      contains its floated children.    
  - **Use:** `.clearfix` utility class is probably the best method to use in general as it doesn't take long to construct and doesn't suffer from clipping issues like the overflow methods.
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/

- [ ] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:** CSS Sprites are a means of combining multiple images into a single image file for use on a website, to help with performance.
  - **Use:** Browsers limit the number of concurrent requests a site can make so leading several images with a single HTTP request helps increase page load speed.
  - **Example:**An example would be combining press logo's for Wired, NY Times and The Washington Post into a single image file. Then on the site, with CSS, placing the file three times and moving/cropping it to display the applicable logo.
  - **Source:**https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/

- [ ] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:**
  - After identifying the issue and the offending browser, use a separate style sheet that only loads when that specific  browser is being used. This technique requires server-side rendering though.
  - Use libraries like Bootstrap that already handles these styling issues for you.
  - Use autoprefixer to automatically add vendor prefixes to your code.
  - Use Reset CSS or Normalize.css.( a combination of both can be used)
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/

- [ ] How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?
  - **Explanation:**
  - Graceful degradation - The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.
  - Progressive enhancement - The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.
  - **Use:**checking [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)  to know what if functional in each browser and using vendor prefixs and polyfills if required.
  - **Example:**Replacing `<div>` with  more semantically appropriate tags like `<section> <aside> <article> <header> <footer>
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/

- [ ] What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
  - **Explanation:**
     - Make the element have a size of zero `width: 0; height: 0`
    - Absolute position off screen `position: absolute; left: -99999px`
    - Text indent off screen if within block element `text-indent: -9999px`
    - aria-label which will read the string given to the attribute.
  - **Use:** Using absolute positioning of an element off screen covers most scenarios.

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
